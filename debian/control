Description: The Connection-Set Algebra implemented in Python
 The CSA library provides elementary connection-sets and operators for
 combining them. It also provides an iteration interface to such
 connection-sets enabling efficient iteration over existing connections
 with a small memory footprint also for very large networks. The CSA
 can be used as a component of neuronal network simulators or other
 tools.
