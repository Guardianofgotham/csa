* Go through how RNG:s are seeded, especially when one CS is used
  repeatedly as component of other CSs

* Go through use of and rename classes Finite and FiniteMask.

* Avoid intersection at top of MaskPartition

* Implement CSsetPartition

* Implement lazy evaluation in BanryCSet.makeValueSetMap

* eliminate _names from _files

* Implement SUbMaskContainer (startIteration etc)

* eliminate code duplication in _elementary.FanInRandomMask
